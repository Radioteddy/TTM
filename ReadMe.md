# TTM code overview

---

This project contains a set of modules for 2T equations solving, 
accounting transfer-matrix absorption profile  


### ttm_main.f90
    This is the main source file for the TTM code. 
    Here you can turn on subrotines for calculation.

    Do not use "time evolution" and "calculate absorption" together. 
    Choose one of them


### layer_parameters.txt
    This file contains parameters of multilayer system. 
    See details in file


### TTM_parameters.txt
    This file contains initial parameters of electron and lattice subsystems.
    Now is FOR ONE LAYER!
    See details in file
    

### laser_parameters.txt
